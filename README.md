# Task Manager API - NestJS
This API was built as part of the challenge I committed to completing. The challenge is to develop the same API in
different programming languages, using different frameworks and ORMs. This version was written using Typescript, using
NestJS as framework and Prisma as ORM.
At the end of the experiment, I will write a post on my blog talking about the experience and the differences between
the technologies used.
